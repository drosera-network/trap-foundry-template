## Overview

This section acts as a tutorial that onboards the user into the Drosera ecosystem. The user will learn how to create a trap, update a trap, create a hydration stream, bloom boost a trap, and interact with the Drosera network.

## Setup

Build and verify the traps by running the following commands:

```bash
# Build
forge build

# Verify
forge test
```

## Hello-World Trap

### Summary

This is a simple trap that contains "Hello, World!". It acts as the first trap for users to deploy with the CLI.

Once the Trap is deployed, the CLI will add an `address` field to the `drosera.toml` file.

### Instructions

Update the `drosera.toml` with the following:

````toml
Update the `drosera.toml` with the following:

```toml
[traps.mytrap]
path = "out/HelloWorldTrap.sol/HelloWorldTrap.json"
response_contract = "0x"
response_function = ""
cooldown_period_blocks = 1000000000
min_number_of_operators = 1
max_number_of_operators = 100
block_sample_size = 10
````

Execute the following commands:

```bash
# See the expected changes
drosera plan

# Apply the changes
DROSERA_PRIVATE_KEY=0x... drosera apply
```

## Alert Trap

### Summary

This trap will call the `alert()` function on a response contract when [....].

### Instructions

Update the `drosera.toml` with the following:

```toml
[traps.mytrap]
path = "out/AlertTrap.sol/AlertTrap.json"
response_contract = <place the address of a contract with an alert function>
response_function = "alert()"
cooldown_period_blocks = 1000000000
min_number_of_operators = 1
max_number_of_operators = 100
block_sample_size = 1
address = <The address that was generated by the CLI upon creating your first trap>
```

Update the trap by running the following commands:

```bash
# See the expected changes
drosera plan

# Apply the changes
DROSERA_PRIVATE_KEY=0x... drosera apply
```

## Trap Explorer

[TODO: Instructions for looking up the trap on the Drosera Trap Explorer]

[TODO: Point out a few key things to look for]

[TODO: Point out hydration stream]

[TODO: Point out bloom boost]

## Create a Hydration Stream via CLI

[TODO: Add CLI command to create a hydration stream]

## Bloom Boost a Trap via CLI

[TODO: Add CLI command to bloom boost a trap]

## Additional Scripting

The sandbox script provides you with a way to deploy other contracts on-chain and experiment with the EVM blockchain.

```bash
# Example of using a script by calling the "main()" function
forge script scripts/Sandbox.s.sol --sig "main()" --fork-url $RPC_URL  --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY --broadcast -vvvv
```

## Next Steps

If you have completed the above steps then you are officially a Trapper, Congratulations!

Continue to experiment with Traps and reach out to the Drosera community for more information on how to get involved.
